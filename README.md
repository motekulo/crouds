# daisyPodal

The idea is to have a guitar pedal that will run patches prototyped on a Daisy Pod. I've started with making it through hole and accessible to build.


## Thanks

For hardware thanks to work on the Dasiy Petal, the Terrarium and most of all [Keith Shepherd](https://github.com/bkshepherd) who really knows what he's doing :)

For software thanks to Graham Wakefield and Gregory Taylor for [Generating Sound and Organizing Time](https://cycling74.com/books/go).

## Things to do - v0.1 to 0.2
- Fix barreljack footprint for centre -ve
- Bigger holes for LM7805 - power regulator
- Spacing on box caps (too wide currently); check with ones from diypedals
- consider rotating C2 (polarised) by 90 degrees to lay it over; or could go to back of board
- LM7805 can go to back of the board
- J1-8 labels can go on back of board as well
- Daisy needs to go on the back of the board - have to press buttons to flash it.
- Should solder in sockets so that the Seed can be inserted without soldering it in place permanently
- Holes for push button switches need to be larger
- add resistors and check circuit for RGB LEDs

## Roadmap
Stereo outputs at some stage
SMD version as well as through hole.
