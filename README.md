# daisyPodal

The idea is to have a guitar pedal that will run patches prototyped on a Daisy Pod. I've started with making it through hole and accessible to build.

[Here's a demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1YsjiImZnQ) of some of the early effects and overall idea.

## Thanks

- For hardware thanks to work on the Dasiy Petal, the Terrarium and the work of  [Keith Shepherd](https://github.com/bkshepherd) 
- Graham Wakefield and Gregory Taylor for [Generating Sound and Organizing Time](https://cycling74.com/books/go). 
- Timothy Schoen for Plugdata

## Things to do - v0.2 to 0.3

- J1-8 labels can go on back of board as well
- fix encoder pins (currently the wrong way around)
- fix schematic connection between pins 1 and 2 of TL074
- increase width of board, and bevel corners to fit in enclosure

## Roadmap
SMD version as well as through hole.
